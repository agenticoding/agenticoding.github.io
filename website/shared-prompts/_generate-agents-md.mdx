## Generate AGENTS.md (Project Context File)

Systematic workflow for bootstrapping project context files using [ChunkHound](https://chunkhound.github.io/) codebase analysis and [ArguSeek](https://github.com/ArguSeek/arguseek) ecosystem research.

### The Prompt

```
Generate AGENTS.md for this project.
Use the code research tool to learn the project architecture, tech stack,
how auth works, testing conventions, coding style, and deployment process.
Use ArguSeek to fetch current best practices for the tech stack used and the
latest security guidelines.

Create a concise file (≤200 lines) with sections:
- Tech Stack
- Development Commands (modified for non-interactive execution)
- Architecture (high-level structure)
- Coding Conventions and Style
- Critical Constraints
- Common Pitfalls (if found).

Do NOT duplicate information already in README or code comments—instead, focus
exclusively on AI-specific operations: environment variables, non-obvious
dependencies, and commands requiring modification for agents.
```

**Adapt sections** for your project: Security Guidelines (sensitive data), API Integration Patterns (microservices), Database Schema (data-intensive), Deployment Checklist (complex workflows).
